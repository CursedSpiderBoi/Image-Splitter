## Image Splitter

The Image Splitter is a Python script that allows users to divide an image into multiple parts based on the specified number of rows and columns. Each part of the image is saved as a separate PNG file.

### Usage

>Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-splitter.git

>Navigate to the directory where the script is located:

    cd image-splitter

>Execute the Python script by providing the image path, number of rows, and number of columns as command-line arguments:
    
    python split_image.py <image_path> <rows> <columns>

---

Example:

    python split_image.py example.jpg 2 2

This command will split the example.jpg image into 2 rows and 2 columns, generating four output files named example-0-0.png, example-0-1.png, example-1-0.png, and example-1-1.png.
